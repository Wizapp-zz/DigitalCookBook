Hello,

 I'm Sebastien, and I try to contact but it seems that GitHub does not offer the option to send message to other users.
 So I am sending you a pull request which contains this message ;-)
 
 Here is my purpose. I have created my own company in 2015 to create mobile applications. My company is named "WizApp" and I'm today officially alone, working for several entreprises.
 A big client of mine has asked me to work with him through GitHub. So I have to create a Github account... I have tried to create `wizapp` account, but I discovered that you already have created it ! (bright idea ! I admit ;-))
 
 I checked your Github activity, and it seems you do not actively use it... so I come to you with some hope ;-)... and here is my request...
 Do you mind if you change your account `wizapp` username to another one so that I can (eg: my company) acquire `wizapp` account name ?
 I have checked that it is completely and easily feasible (`Upper-right menu > Settings > Account > Change username`)
 
 I let you my mail address below for you to contact me and if you agree with my request - I hope so much ! ;-)
 
 My name is SÃ©bastien Royer and also, you can reach me at [sroyer@wizapp.fr](mailto:sroyer@wizapp.fr).
 
 You can check WizApp website here if you want: [https://www.wizapp.fr](https://www.wizapp.fr)
 
 Whatever, if also you are interested in developping Mobile applications, or any software for money, please let me know, I can give you remote work..
 
 In any case, and whatever your decision, I wish you the best.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Sebastien
